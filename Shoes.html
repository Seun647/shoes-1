<h3>These shoes are crafted to withstand the toughest conditions, from rain-soaked streets to rugged terrain. Not only are they durable and waterproof, but they also exude a sense of style that is unmatched.Our iconic Timberland Yellow Boot is made from nubuck leather, but we use a variety of different materials to ensure each pair of Timberland boots does its job correctly. Most of our uppers are made of leather, which can be hard-wearing full-grain, stylish suede, or best-of-both nubuck.</h3>
<h3><p>At Timberland, we aim to only work with leather sourced from LWG silver or gold-rated tanneries, which follow environmental best practices. With high-quality inners, soles and binding, our boots become the comfortable, dry and stylish footwear thatâ€™s popular the world over. </p></h3>
